        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <img src="images/cntraveler.JPG" width="350" alt="cntraveler.com">
        <p>Conde Nast does a great job of drawing the eyes of site vistors using the Rule of Thirds on the pictures featured on the site. 
            The Rule of Thirds is when an image is divided into nine equal parts by placing two equally spaced horizontal lines and two 
            equally spaced vertical lines. The focal point should be placed along these lines or at their intersections. The goal of this 
            site is to get interest in different places to go, and a well thought out picture helps drive the interest in reading the articles.

        <img src="images/wayfair.JPG" width="350" alt="wayfair.com">
        <p>Wayfair does a nice job of keeping the site organized and inviting by the use of white space. The proper use of white space allows this site
            to be more readable, gives it a clean organized look, and simple to navigate. These are all things that enhance the site users experience,
            and draws them back to the page.
